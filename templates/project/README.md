# About

This project was generated by the restapi tool. Its main purpose is to create and run tests against your RESTful API using a declarative descriptor as input.
The service descriptors are yaml files under the `services folder`.
YAML is a user friendly, easily writable format.
The descriptor is both a documentation of your RESTful API and the input for the test generator.
